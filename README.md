I am a Research Software Engineer at Princeton University, working with the Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP). I focus on developing tools needed to tackle the challenges posed by the high volume and complexity of the data that will be collected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN and other future HEP experiments.

Current projects:

- [Line Segment Tracking (LST)](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper): I am collaborating with a team of researchers in the CMS Collaboration to develop a highly parallelizable algorithm to reconstruct tracks from particle collisions. The aim of the project is to replace current CPU algorithms with a new one that runs on GPUs and can keep up with the high complexity of the data that will be collected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).

Past projects:

- [CYTools](https://cy.tools): I co-developed this package during my PhD at Cornell, with the aim of gathering and improving the best computational tools in string phenomenology. I developed multiple novel algorithms, achieving exponentially better performance compared to standard mathematical software. This package is still in active development and is being used by multiple research groups.
