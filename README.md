I am a theoretical physicist and computational scientist who will soon graduate with a PhD in Physics from Cornell University. My work in graduate school has revolved around exploring solutions of String Theory using computational algebraic geometry. I have developed powerful new algorithms to perform computations exponentially faster than with existing mathematical software. All of these advancements are now available in the open-source package CYTools, which I created in an effort to drive progress in the field. This package has allowed unprecedentedly complex constructions and is now being used by multiple groups around the world.

I am now seeking to leverage my expertise in a new field. I am interested in solving difficult problems and tackling the biggest computational challenges. My Physics and Mathematics background allows me to have a deep understanding of the underlying data and exploit mathematical structures to engineer exceptional algorithms. I hope to continue making outstanding computational contributions as I did in String Theory.
